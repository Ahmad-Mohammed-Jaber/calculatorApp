Credit to Web Dev Simplifed on Youtube for the tutorial <br>
Needed the tutorial mostly for the CSS bits

## Changes over the tutorial
-  Made use of sematic HTML by making sure to use the H1 and H2 tags for the result and previous result fields respectivly 
-  Used flex to align the calculator display and the buttons
-  Implemeted JS logic independently
-  Used Google's Roboto Mono Font
